  abstract = {Background Despite the increasing belief that the places where people live influence their health, there is surprisingly little consistent evidence for their associations with mental health. We investigated the joint effect of community and individual-level socio-economic deprivation and social cohesion on individual mental health status.
Methods Multilevel analysis of population survey data on 10 653 adults aged 18\textendash{}74 years nested within the 325 census enumeration districts in Caerphilly county borough, Wales, UK. The outcome measure was the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) subscale of the SF-36 instrument. A social cohesion subscale was derived from a factor analysis of responses to the Neighbourhood Cohesion scale and was modelled at individual and area level. Area income deprivation was measured by the percentage of low income households.
Results Poor mental health was significantly associated with area-level income deprivation and low social cohesion after adjusting for individual risk factors. High social cohesion significantly modified the association between income deprivation and mental health: the difference between the predicted mean area mental health scores at the 10th and 90th centiles of the low income distribution was 3.7 in the low cohesion group and 0.9 in the high cohesion group (difference of the difference in means \textonequarter{} 2.8, 95\% CI: 0.2, 5.4).
Conclusions Income deprivation and social cohesion measured at community level are potentially important joint determinants of mental health. Further research on the impact of the social environment on mental health should investigate causal pathways in a longitudinal study.},

Drawing from a major cross-disciplinary investigation of food access and food poverty in British cities, the authors report in this paper findings from the first `before/after' study of food consumption in a highly deprived area of a British city experiencing a sudden and significant change in its food-retail access. The study has been viewed as the first opportunity in the United Kingdom to assess the impact of a non-healthcare intervention (specifically a retail-provision intervention) on food-consumption patterns, and by extension diet-related health, in such a deprived, previously poor-retail-access community. The paper offers evidence of a positive but modest impact of the retail intervention on diet, and the authors discuss the ways in which their findings are potentially significant in the context of policy debate.},

  shorttitle = {Deprivation and Mortality},
  abstract = {This paper aims at investigating whether the relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation is affected by the spatial autocorrelation of ecological data. A simple model is used in which mortality (all-ages and premature) is the dependent variable, and deprivation, morbidity and other socio-economic indicators are the explanatory variables. Deprivation is measured by the Townsend index; the other socio-economic variables are the median income, unequal income distribution (Gini coefficient) and population density. Morbidity is estimated on the basis of hospital admission rates and overweight prevalence. Spatial autocorrelation is measured by the Moran's I coefficient. All mortality and morbidity variables have significant, positive, and moderate-to-high spatial autocorrelation. Two multivariate models are explored: a weighted least-squares model ignoring spatial autocorrelation and a simultaneous autoregressive model. The paper concludes that spatial autocorrelation has a significant impact on the relationship between mortality and socio-economic variables. Future ecological models intended to inform health resources allocation need to pay greater attention to the spatial dimension of the data used. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  shorttitle = {Car Dependence in Rural {{Scotland}}},
  abstract = {This paper examines dependence on the car in rural Scotland, assesses the impact of the fuel duty escalator on rural communities and discusses the role of the new Scottish Executive in shaping future rural transport policy. Questionnaires, interviews and travel diaries were used in "ve areas and revealed that households in rural Scotland enjoy high levels of car ownership, and that the car is used for over three-quarters of all journeys. Isolation and income levels are the most signi"cant predictors of car use. Those living in \&removed' areas * i.e. locations distant from main roads and/or bus routes * are more likely to own vehicles and make a higher proportion of their journeys by car. A\%uent households enjoy higher levels of car ownership, and make more journeys over greater distances by this mode than those on low-incomes. Less a\%uent households are also more likely to have disposed of a vehicle without replacing it, suggesting a more \#uctuating dependence on the car. Although those living in rural Scotland appear to count on the car, a distinction is made between those who have no alternative (structurally dependent) and those who have alternatives but rely on their vehicles. It is di\$cult to predict the exact impact of the fuel duty escalator, but it is argued that the majority of households will cope with increases in the cost of motoring, while a signi"cant minority of low income households in isolated areas will struggle to absorb the extra cost. The study highlights the need for the Scottish legislature to secure additional funding in order to sustain rural communities in the face of the rising fuel costs and suggests that an appropriate policy response might be to support isolated shops and services, i.e. subsidising alternatives to the journey as well as alternatives to the car. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It advocates directly studying features of the local social and physical environment which might promote or inhibit health, illustrating this approach with some findings from a study in the West of Scotland, and suggests that improvements in public health might be achieved by focusing on places as well as on people.},

  volume = {15},
  issn = {1471-2458},
  shorttitle = {Are Area-Based Initiatives Able to Improve Area Safety in Deprived Areas?},
  abstract = {Background: Numerous area-based initiatives have been implemented in deprived areas across Western-Europe with the aim to improve the socio-economic and environmental conditions in these areas. Only few of these initiatives have been scientifically evaluated for their impact on key social determinants of health, like perceived area safety. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of a Dutch area-based initiative called the District Approach on trends in perceived area safety and underlying problems in deprived target districts.
Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used. Repeated cross-sectional data on perceived area safety and underlying problems were obtained from the National Safety Monitor (2005\textendash{}2008) and its successor the Integrated Safety Monitor (2008\textendash{}2011). Study population consisted of 133,522 Dutch adults, including 3,595 adults from target districts. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to assess trends in self-reported general safety, physical order, social order, and non-victimization before and after the start of the District Approach mid-2008. Trends in target districts were compared with trends in various control groups.
Results: Residents of target districts felt less safe, perceived less physical and social order, and were victimized more often than adults elsewhere in the Netherlands. For non-victimization, target districts showed a somewhat more positive change in trend after the start of the District Approach than the rest of the Netherlands or other deprived districts. Differences were only statistically significant in women, older adults, and lower educated adults. For general safety, physical order, and social order, there were no differences in trend change between target districts and control groups.
Conclusions: Results suggest that the District Approach has been unable to improve perceptions of area safety and disorder in deprived areas, but that it did result in declining victimization rates.},

The varieties of approaches taken by researchers concerned with teasing out the relative importance of geographical factors that may influence access are examined. To date, in the absence of detailed data on health utilisation patterns, much of this research has focused on developing measures of potential accessibility. This paper then critically evaluates the situation with regard to the use of such measures in a broad range of accessibility studies. In particular, there has been less research to date that examines the relationship between such measures and health outcomes. In the final sections of the paper, I draw on the review to outline areas where a broader research agenda is needed, particularly in relation to more recent innovations in health care delivery.},

  shorttitle = {A Dose of Realism for Healthy Urban Policy},
  abstract = {Many urban policies aim to improve areas and address socioeconomic deprivation. The resulting investment is often delivered through area-based programmes which incorporate initiatives to improve the physical, social and economic environment. Hypotheses that these investments can contribute to wider public health strategies are based on epidemiological data and used to support the concept of healthy urban policy. However, there is little evidence on their ability to generate positive impacts on socioeconomic or health outcomes. The lack of validating evidence on actual impacts raises two important questions: (1) Is areabased investment an effective strategy to tackle socioeconomic deprivation? (2) What is the prospect for new and improved evaluations to provide stronger evidence? Both the programmes of area investment and their accompanying evaluations have been criticised for being overly ambitious in what can be achieved by the investment and what can be measured by an evaluation. Area-based approaches to tackling deprivation have their advantages but a mix of area and individual-level targeting is likely to be needed. While there is scope to improve the utility of evaluation data there are also inevitable constraints on assessing and attributing impacts from urban investment. The inherent limitations to an area-based approach and the ongoing constraints on impact evaluation will inevitably temper expectations of what healthy urban policy can achieve. However, lack of evidence is not grounds to abandon the concept of healthy urban policy; adoption of more realistic expectations together with improved evaluation data may help to increase its credibility.},

Although the literature contains a vast collection of approximate functions for the normal distribution, they are very complicated, not very accurate, or valid for only a limited range. This paper proposes an enhanced approximate function. When comparing the proposed function to other approximations studied in the literature, it can be observed that the proposed logistic approximation has a simpler functional form and that it gives higher accuracy, with the maximum error of less than 0.00014 for the entire range. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the lowest level of error reported in the literature. The proposed logistic approximate function may be appealing to researchers, practitioners and educators given its functional simplicity and mathematical accuracy.},

  title = {Setting Accessibility Standards for Social Inclusion: Some Obstacles},
  abstract = {One of the principal rationales for accessibility planning in the UK is the potential reduction of social exclusion. Although there are multiple causes of social exclusion, transport and accessibility limitations contribute to a greater or lesser extent. It is in the light of this understanding the transport authorities are asked to devise policies which will promote inclusion. However, although the literature on social exclusion/inclusion is now quite substantial, and there are a number of Government documents available explaining the connections and their consequences, transport authorities are given little, if any, guidance by Central Government about the levels of accessibility to which they should and could reasonably be expected to aspire. This paper is based around research initially undertaken as part of an EPSRC-funded project \textendash{} AUNT-SUE (Accessibility and User Needs in Transport for Sustainable Urban Environments) which aims ``to develop and test sustainable policies and practice that will deliver effective socially inclusive design and operation in transport and the associated public realm from macro down to micro level.'' As part of this project, accessibility benchmarks and standards appropriate to various socially-excluded groups have been, and are being, developed and tested using both existing data and field research. The paper discusses the progress of this work and the difficulties of arriving at solutions which can both adequately reflect the needs of the affected groups, as groups rather than individuals, and which can also be successfully modelled.},

Overall classification accuracies between pixelbased and object-based classifications were not statistically significant (p {$>$} 0.05) when the same machine learning algorithms were applied. Using object-based image analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in classification accuracy between maps produced using the DT algorithm compared to maps produced using either RF (p = 0.0116) or SVM algorithms (p = 0.0067). Using pixel-based image analysis, there was no statistically significant difference (p {$>$} 0.05) between results produced using different classification algorithms. Classifications based on RF and SVM algorithms provided a more visually adequate depiction of wetland, riparian, and crop land cover types when compared to DT based classifications, using either object-based or pixel-based image analysis. In this study, pixel-based classifications utilized fewer variables (15 vs. 300), achieved similar classification accuracies, and required less time to produce than object-based classifications. Object-based classifications produced a visually appealing generalized appearance of land cover classes. Based exclusively on overall accuracy reports, there was no advantage to preferring one image analysis approach over another for the purposes of mapping broad land cover types in agricultural environments using medium spatial resolution earth observation imagery.},

This work is important in measuring the association between target setting and road safety improvement, because such targets are intended to serve as a useful tool to motivate timely road safety measures by the road authorities and others. The estimates to be rectified were based on before-and-after analysis using a comparison group of countries for each country that had set a target. This note first provides a correction to the qualification test for the inclusion of a country in any particular comparison group. It then presents the numerical effects of this correction on the estimates of the effectiveness of setting quantified road safety targets, both in individual countries and across the whole group of countries that set targets in the relevant period. Finally, impacts on the findings of the previous paper are discussed, with the conclusion that the changes in those of the numerical estimates that are affected do not alter the main message of the paper.},

The challenge in automated generalisation of road networks is to derive a connected network while maintaining the structure for the intended target scale and to achieve this with minimum user intervention. A lot of methods to select, displace and simplify roads have been presented; the focus here is on the generalisation of networks using visual perception techniques. This paper presents a framework based on visual perception that uses minimum attributes for generalisation of both `rural' and `urban' roads over large scale change. The system incorporated graph theoretic techniques to explicitly model the topology of the network as it was generalized. The model uses a fine scale map (1:1250 or 1:2500) as input and generates small scale (1:250,000) maps directly from it without creating intermediate small scale maps. The results compared favorably with paper maps (Ordnance Surveys Stratgie dataset (1:250,000)).},

The most common applications were two-level models where individuals were nested within contexts. Most studies were nonexperimental and used nonprobability samples. The amount of data at each level varied widely across studies, as did the number of models examined. Analyses of reporting practices indicated some clear problems, with many articles not reporting enough information for a reader to critique the reported analyses. For example, in many articles, one could not determine how many models were estimated, what covariance structure was assumed, what type of centering if any was used, whether the data were consistent with assumptions, whether outliers were present, or how the models were estimated. Guidelines for researchers reporting multilevel analyses are provided.},

This approach relies on the potential of the local variance (LV) to detect scale transitions in geospatial data. The tool detects the number of layers added to a project and segments them iteratively with a multiresolution segmentation algorithm in a bottom-up approach, where the scale factor in the segmentation, namely, the scale parameter (SP), increases with a constant increment. The average LV value of the objects in all of the layers is computed and serves as a condition for stopping the iterations: when a scale level records an LV value that is equal to or lower than the previous value, the iteration ends, and the objects segmented in the previous level are retained. Three orders of magnitude of SP lags produce a corresponding number of scale levels. Tests on very high resolution imagery provided satisfactory results for generic applicability. The tool has a significant potential for enabling objectivity and automation of GEOBIA analysis.},

Traditionally, intensity information has not been used in feature extraction from LIDAR data because the data is too noisy. This article deals with using as much of the recorded laser information as possible thus both height and intensity are used. To extract roads from a LIDAR point cloud, a hierarchical classification technique is used to classify the LIDAR points progressively into road or non-road. Initially, an accurate digital terrain model (DTM) model is created by using successive morphological openings with different structural element sizes. Individual laser points are checked for both a valid intensity range and height difference from the subsequent DTM. A series of filters are then passed over the road candidate image to improve the accuracy of the classification. The success rate of road detection and the level of detail of the resulting road image both depend on the resolution of the laser scanner data and the types of roads expected to be found. The presence of road-like features within the survey area such as private roads and car parks is discussed and methods to remove this information are entertained. All algorithms used are described and applied to an example urban test site.},

Drawing on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (2000), a multi-relational database, an examination is undertaken of the occurrence, nature and extent of social exclusion within and between seaside resorts in England. The study findings reveal that seaside districts, wards and resorts are experiencing higher levels of multiple deprivation than might be expected. In addition, it shows that while there is remarkable similarity in the nature and extent of multiple deprivation being experienced, variations in the socio-economic characteristics of those resorts most affected suggest that their predicament is more complex than first appears. Three important implications for resort restructuring are highlighted. First, it must avoid being too tourism centric and instead should adopt a more holistic approach. Second a `one size fit' approach is inappropriate and third, there is an urgent need for further in-depth research.},

  abstract = {This article aims to assess the role of religion and religiousness in engendering higher US fertility compared to Europe. Religion is important in the life of one-half of US women, whereas not even for one of six Europeans. By every available measure, American women are more religious than European women. Catholic and Protestant women have notably higher fertility than those not belonging to any denomination in the US and across Europe. In all European regions and in the United States as well as among all denominations the more devout have more children. However, women in Northern and Western Europe who are the least religious have equivalent or even higher fertility than women in the US, and notably higher fertility than those in Southern Europe. This suggests that forces other than religion and religiousness are also important in their impact on childbearing. A multivariate analysis demonstrates that relatively ``traditional'' socioeconomic covariates (age, marital status, residence, education, and income) do not substantially change the positive association of religiousness and fertility. Finally, if Europeans were as religious as Americans one might theoretically expect a small fertility increase for Europe as a whole, but considerably more for Western Europe.},

  abstract = {Driving speed is an important factor in road safety. Speed not only affects the severity of a crash, but is also related to the risk of being involved in a crash. This paper discusses the most important empirical studies into speed and crash rate with an emphasis on the more recent studies. The majority of these studies looked at absolute speed, either at individual vehicle level or at road section level. Respectively, they found evidence for an exponential function and a power function between speed and crash rate. Both types of studies found evidence that crash rate increases faster with an increase in speed on minor roads than on major roads. At a more detailed level, lane width, junction density, and traffic flow were found to interact with the speed\textendash{}crash rate relation. Other studies looked at speed dispersion and found evidence that this is also an important factor in determining crash rate. Larger differences in speed between vehicles are related to a higher crash rate. Without exception, a vehicle that moved (much) faster than other traffic around it, had a higher crash rate. With regard to the rate of a (much) slower moving vehicle, the evidence is inconclusive.},

  abstract = {A method for the automatic detection and vectorization of roads from lidar data is presented. To extract roads from a lidar point cloud, a hierarchical classification technique is used to classify the lidar points progressively into road and non-road points. During the classification process, both intensity and height values are initially used. Due to the homogeneous and consistent nature of roads, a local point density is introduced to finalize the classification. The resultant binary classification is then vectorized by convolving a complex-valued disk named the Phase Coded Disk (PCD) with the image to provide three separate pieces of information about the road. The centerline and width of the road are obtained from the resultant magnitude image while the direction is determined from the corresponding phase image, thus completing the vectorized road model. All algorithms used are described and applied to two urban test sites. Completeness values of 0.88 and 0.79 and correctness values of 0.67 and 0.80 were achieved for the classification phase of the process. The vectorization of the classified results yielded RMS values of 1.56 m and 1.66 m, completeness values of 0.84 and 0.81 and correctness values of 0.75 and 0.80 for two different data sets.},

The aim of the paper is to encourage students and advocates of geography to think a little about what they are involved in (and to think about the role of academia more generally). Recent publications in a number of geography journals have revealed much angst among prominent geographers concerning the state of human geography and, in particular, its links to contemporary policy debate. However, while geographers discuss the debate, we argue that they are not a significant part of it. We take a critical turn and look at the debate that two geographers \textendash{} Ron Martin and Doreen Massey \textendash{} have raised within the light of wider debates on public policy, politics, quantification, academia and the policy agenda. We conclude that for many reasons there is unlikely to be a large shift towards policy-orientated research within human geography.},

  abstract = {Although levels of fertility in most sub-Saharan Africa have not shown significant trends in the past few decades, substantial fertility differentials exist between countries and between regions and socioeconomic groups within countries. This paper examines the proximate determinants of fertility that are responsible for these variations in fertility. Particular attention is given to the biological and behavioral factors, such as postpartum abstinence, prolonged breastfeeding, and pathological sterility, which are crucial determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a simple analytic model, the relative fertility-inhibiting effects of the proximate determinants are quantified, and from this analysis an assessment is made of prospects for future trends in fertility. It is concluded that rapid declines in fertility are unlikely to occur in the near future, partly because desired family size is very high and partly because upward pressure on fertility levels will result from the erosion of traditional childspacing practices of postpartum abstinence and prolonged breastfeeding or from declines in levels of pathological sterility in response to public health measures.},

To come from irregular 3D point clouds to useful representations and formats for an end-user requires continued research and development of methods and algorithms for interpretation and modelling. This paper presents some methods and algorithms concerning filtering for determining the ground surface, DEM, classification of buildings for 3D City Models and the detection of electrical power lines.

The reason is that noises or interferences always badly affect the measured results. So, to detect the weak signals buried in noises is a fundamental and important problem in the Lidar systems. It has been found that digital filters are not suitable for processing Lidar signals in noises, while the wavelet transform is an efficient tool for signal analysis in time\textendash{}frequency domain that is very sensitive to the transient signals. In this paper, we propose a new method of the Lidar signal acquisition based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT). This method can significantly improve the SNR so that the effective measured range of Lidar is increased. The performance for our method is investigated by detecting the simulating and real Lidar signals in white noise. To contrast, the results of Butterworth filter, which is a kind of finite impulse response (FIR) filter, are also demonstrated. Finally, the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the traditional methods.},

  abstract = {Green spaces play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological and social systems, a fact recognised in public policy commitments in both the UK and Europe. The amount of provision, the distribution of green space and the ease of access to such spaces are key contributors to social and ecological function in urban environments. We measured distance along the transport network to public green space available to households in Sheffield, and compared this with the distribution of private garden space. In addition, we used a geodemographic database, Mosaic UK, to examine how access to green space varies across different sectors of society. Public green spaces are chronically underprovided relative to recommended targets. For example, 64\% of Sheffield households fail to meet the recommendation of the regulatory agency English Nature (EN), that people should live no further than 300 m from their nearest green space. Moreover, this figure rises to 72\% if we restrict attention to municipal parks recognised by the local council. There is an overall reduction in coverage by green space when moving from neighbourhoods where green space is primarily publicly provided to those where it is privately provided. While access to public green space varies significantly across different social groups, those enjoying the greatest access include more deprived groups and older people. This study highlights the need for additional green space to be created and existing green space to be protected in light of increasing development pressure.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with methods for analysing spatial data. After initial discussion on the nature of spatial data, including the concept of randomness, we focus most of our attention on linear regression models that involve interactions between agents across space. The introduction of spatial variables in to standard linear regression provides a flexible way of characterising these interactions, but complicates both interpretation and estimation of parameters of interest. The estimation of these models leads to three fundamental challenges: the reflection problem, the presence of omitted variables and problems caused by sorting. We consider possible solutions to these problems, with a particular focus on restrictions on the nature of interactions. We show that similar assumptions are implicit in the empirical strategies - fixed effects or spatial differencing - used to address these problems in reduced form estimation. These general lessons carry over to the policy evaluation literature.},

An unstructured and sparse point cloud is first projected onto the camera image plane and then upsampled to obtain a set of dense 2D images encoding spatial information. Several fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) are then trained to carry out road detection, either by using data from a single sensor, or by using three fusion strategies: early, late, and the newly proposed cross fusion. Whereas in the former two fusion approaches, the integration of multimodal information is carried out at a predefined depth level, the cross fusion FCN is designed to directly learn from data where to integrate information; this is accomplished by using trainable cross connections between the LIDAR and the camera processing branches.},

In the second step, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to classify the LiDAR data into two classes, road and non-road. For this classification, SVM indicated the merged distance layer with intensity data and yielded better identification of the road position. Assessments of the obtained results showed 63\% correctness, 75\% completeness and 52\% quality of classification. In the next step, road edges were defined in the LiDAR-extracted layers, enabling accurate digitizing of the centerline location. More than 95\% of the LiDAR-derived road was digitized within 1.3 m to the field surveyed normal. The proposed approach can provide thorough and accurate road inventory data to support forest management.},

  abstract = {Automated and reliable 3D city model acquisition is an increasing demand. Automatic road extraction from dense urban areas is a challenging issue due to the high complex image scene. From imagery, the obstacles of the extraction stem mainly from the difficulty of finding clues of the roads and complexity of the contextual environments. One of the promising methods to deal with this is to use data sources from multi-sensors, by which the multiple clues and constraints can be obtained so that the uncertainty can be minimized significantly. This paper focuses on the integrated processing of high resolution imagery and LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data for automatic extraction of grid structured urban road network. Under the guidance of an explicit model of the urban roads in a grid structure, the method firstly detects the primitives or clues of the roads and the contextual targets (i.e., parking lots, grasslands) both from the color image and lidar data by segmentation and image analysis. Evidences of road existing are contained in the primitives. The candidate road stripes are detected by an iterative Hough transform algorithm. This is followed by an procedure of evidence finding and validation by taking advantage of high resolution imagery and direct height information of the scene derived from lidar data. Finally the road network is formed by topology analysis. In this paper, the strategy and corresponding algorithms are described. The test data set is color ortho-imagery with 0.5 m resolution and lidar data of Toronto downtown area. The experimental results in the typical dense urban scene indicate it is able to extract the roads much more reliable and accurate by the integrated processing than by using imagery or lidar separately. It saliently exhibits advantages of the integrated processing of the multiple data sources for the road extraction from the complicated scenes.},

  title = {Segmentation of {{LiDAR Point Clouds}} for {{Building Extraction}}},
  abstract = {The objective of segmentation on point clouds is to spatially group points with similar properties into homogeneous regions. Segmentation is a fundamental issue in processing point clouds data acquired by LiDAR and the quality of segmentation largely determines the success of information retrieval. Unlike the image or TIN model, the point clouds do not explicitly represent topology information. As a result, most existing segmentation methods for image and TIN have encountered two difficulties. First, converting data from irregular 3-D point clouds to other models usually leads to information loss; this is particularly a serious drawback for range image based algorithms. Second, the high computation cost of converting a large volume of point data is a considerable problem for any large scale LiDAR application. In this paper, we investigate the strategy to develop LiDAR segmentation methods directly based on point clouds data model. We first discuss several potential local similarity measures based on discrete computation geometry and machine learning. A prototype algorithm supported by fast nearest neighborhood search and based on advanced similarity measures is proposed and implemented to segment point clouds directly. Our experiments show that the proposed method is efficient and robust comparing with algorithms based on image and TIN. The paper will review popular segmentation methods in related disciplines and present the segmentation results of diverse buildings with different levels of difficulty.},

Although laser altimetry is full integrated into processes for the production of digital elevation models in different countries, the derivation of DEM's from the raw laser altimetry measurements still causes problems. In particular the laser pulses reflected on the ground surface need to be distinguished from those reflecting on buildings and vegetation. In this paper a new method is proposed for filtering laser data. This method is closely related to the erosion operator used for mathematical grey scale morphology. Based on height differences in a representative training dataset, filter functions are derived that either preserve important terrain characteristics or minimise the number of classification errors. In experiments it is shown that the latter filter causes smaller errors in the resulting digital elevation models. In general the performance of the filters deteriorates with a decreasing point density.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach to creating a polyhedral model of building roof from LiDAR point clouds using clustering techniques. A building point cloud is first separated into planar and breakline sections using the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix in a small neighbourhood. The planar components from the point cloud are then grouped into small patches containing 6-8 points and their normal vector parameters are determined. The normal vectors are then clustered together to determine the principal directions of the roof planes. Directly using a clustering algorithm on normal vectors presents difficulties due to a lack of a-priori information on approximate roof directions. Therefore, a potential based approach is used iteratively with the k-means algorithm. This generates the necessary planar parameters, and segments the LiDAR roof points. For reconstruction, a plane adjacency matrix is created for the roof using the segmented roof points. Planes that intersect each other are identified and breaklines and roof vertices are generated by solving the intersecting planar equations. A vector polyhedral model of the roof is created.},

  title = {Object {{Extraction}} from {{LiDAR Data}} Using an {{Artificial Swarm Bee Colony Clustering Algorithm}}},
  abstract = {Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems have become a standard data collection technology for capturing object surface information and 3D modeling of urban areas. Although, LIDAR systems provide detailed valuable geometric information, they still require extensive interpretation of their data for object extraction and recognition to make it practical for mapping purposes. A fundamental step in the transformation of the LIDAR data into objects is the segmentation of LIDAR data through a clustering process. Nevertheless, due to scene complexity and the variety of objects in urban areas, e.g. buildings, roads, and trees, clustering using only one single cue will not reach meaningful results. The multi dimensionality nature of LIDAR data, e.g. laser range and intensity information in both first and last echo, allow the use of more information in the data clustering process and ultimately into the reconstruction scheme. Multi dimensionality nature of LIDAR data with a dense sampling interval in urban applications, provide a huge amount of valuable information. However, this amount of information produces a lot of problems for traditional clustering techniques. This paper describes the potential of an artificial swarm bee colony optimization algorithm to find global solutions to the clustering problem of multi dimensional LIDAR data in urban areas. The artificial bee colony algorithm performs neighborhood search combined with random search in a way that is reminiscent of the food foraging behavior of swarms of honey bees. Hence, by integrating the simplicity of the k-means algorithm with the capability of the artificial bee colony algorithm, a robust and efficient clustering method for object extraction from LIDAR data is presented in this paper. This algorithm successfully applied to different LIDAR data sets in different urban areas with different size and complexities.},

  abstract = {The road extraction in urban areas is difficult task due to the complicated patterns and many contextual objects. LiDAR data directly provides three dimensional (3D) points with less occlusions and smaller shadows. The elevation information and surface roughness are distinguishing features to separate roads. However, LiDAR data has some disadvantages are not beneficial to object extraction, such as the irregular distribution of point clouds and lack of clear edges of roads. For these problems, this paper proposes an automatic road centerlines extraction method which has three major steps: (1) road center point detection based on multiple feature spatial clustering for separating road points from ground points, (2) local principal component analysis with least squares fitting for extracting the primitives of road centerlines, and (3) hierarchical grouping for connecting primitives into complete roads network. Compared with MTH (consist of Mean shift algorithm, Tensor voting, and Hough transform) proposed in our previous article, this method greatly reduced the computational cost. To evaluate the proposed method, the Vaihingen data set, a benchmark testing data provided by ISPRS for ``Urban Classification and 3D Building Reconstruction'' project, was selected. The experimental results show that our method achieve the same performance by less time in road extraction using LiDAR data.},

  abstract = {Endemic problems in EU `lagging rural regions' (LRRs) are well documented and various support mechanisms have long been in place to help overcome structural difficulties. Nevertheless, new rural development architectures are now being sought and some scholars have posited that LRRs may benefit from the `quality (re)turn' in food and a relative shift from long to short food supply chains. The ways in which this `new agriculture' relates to rural development in lagging regions sound fine in theory. However, in practice it is far from clear what will actually happen, where and how. This paper attempts to answer some of these questions and, using a Delphi technique, to forecast those factors likely to influence supply chain development and performance in two LRRs in the UK: West Wales and the Scottish\textendash{}English Borders. The findings suggest that while most experts willingly accept the socio-economic values that can be gained by localising, shortening and synergising the food chain in LRRs, there are also important barriers that question the emergence of such an agrarian based rural development dynamic. These include the small number and size of `alternative' producers in both locales, with most still locked into industrial forms of production; the restrictive influence of bureaucracy; the shortfall of key intermediaries in both regions' food chains; and the poor provision of key physical infrastructures (e.g. roads, railway and telecommunications). The Delphi method also reveals how expert opinions about rural development in LRRs are contingent and contested, with contradictions emerging within, as well as between, rounds.},

  abstract = {Due mainly to increasing difficulties in recruiting and retaining health professionals to work in remote and peripheral areas of Scotland, there is discussion of the need to implement new models of primary health care provision. However, innovative service models may imply a reduction in the number of health professionals who live and work in remote communities. Currently decisions about remodelling service provision are being taken by National Health Service stakeholders, apparently with little consideration of the wider social and economic impacts of change. This paper aims to argue that health professionals contribute to the fabric of rural life in a number of ways and that decisions about health service redesign need to take this into account. As well as fulfilling a wide health and social care role for patients, the authors seek to show that health professionals are important to the social sustainability of rural communities as, due to their unique position, they are often at the heart of networks within and between communities. The wider economic contribution of health services in remote communities is important, but often underplayed. The authors propose that theories of capital, principally the concept of social capital, could help in investigating the wider contribution of health professionals to their local communities. Ultimately, it is proposed that health services, as embodied in nurses, doctors and others, could be highly important to the ongoing livelihood and social infrastructure of fragile remote communities. Since this area is poorly understood, there is a need for prospective primary research and evaluation of service redesign initiatives.},

  abstract = {Debate about rural policy is often based on persistent presumptions about conditions in `rural England', generally associated with economic decline, low incomes, and a lack of services. Such generalisations are rarely justified for rural areas as a whole and we term them as `stylised fallacies'. The impression of their relevance is perpetuated by the selective comparison of statistics for `urban' and `rural' areas. The paper reviews the evidence on a number of such fallacies: the economic impact of agriculture, depopulation, low incomes, rural labour markets, house prices and service provision. In each case, the position is far more complex than is commonly recognised in policy debate. The rural character of an area does not in itself offer a rationale for policy intervention. Rather, discussion could be supported through the characterisation of different types of local area. This might be approached either through statistical analysis or through qualitative analysis of emerging social and economic patterns of differentiation. In practice, each approach needs to be supported through the other.},

  volume = {73},
  issn = {02779536},
  abstract = {This study is situated within the international literature on geographic health inequalities between urban and rural areas. Using data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS LS), this paper assesses the role of residential mobility within England between 1981 and 2001 in explaining geographic inequalities in all-cause mortality between urban and rural Local Authority Districts at the end of the period (deaths occurring between 2001 and 2005). First, the pattern of directly age-standardised death rates (2001e2005) in urban and rural areas of residence in 2001 is examined and compared with the pattern that would have been seen if the observed death/survival of individuals had occurred in their original place of residence in 1981, or in 1991. Secondly, logistic regression is applied to examine whether individuals' residential mobility between urban and rural areas predict the risk of mortality, adjusting for people's socio-demographic characteristics. Findings show that, for this sample, residential mobility 1981e2001 accounts for about 30\% of the urbanerural inequalities in mortality observed at the end of the period. LS members who were residentially mobile between urban and rural areas were relatively healthier than long-term urban residents, with better mortality outcomes among rural in-migrants. In age-stratified analysis, LS members of working age (20e64 years) moving out of rural areas, and LS members of retirement age (65 years and older) moving into rural areas, were shown to be healthier. Processes of selective migration in and out of rural areas in England are complex and may partly explain urbanerural health inequalities. In terms of varying mortality risk, findings also highlight the possible marginalisation and disadvantage of sub-groups of the rural population.},

  shorttitle = {Driving on Urban Roads},
  abstract = {The subjective categories that drivers use to distinguish between different road types have been shown to influence the speeds they choose to drive but as yet we do not understand the road features that drivers use to make their discriminations. To better understand how drivers describe and categorise the roads they drive, 55 participants were recruited to drive a video of familiar urban roads in a driving simulator at the speed they would drive these roads in their own cars (using the accelerator and brake pedal in the driving simulator to adjust their speed). The participants were then asked to sort photos of the roads they had just driven into piles so that their driving would be the same on all roads in one pile but different to the other piles. Finally, they answered a series of questions about each road to indicate what speed they would drive, the safe speed for the road, their speed limit belief as well as providing ratings of comfort, difficulty and familiarity. Overall, drivers' categorisation of roads was informed by a number of factors including speed limit belief, road features and markings (including medians), road width, and presence of houses, driveways and footpaths. The participants' categories were congruent with what they thought the speed limits were, but not necessarily the actual speed limits. Mismatches between actual speed limits and speed limit beliefs appeared to result from category-level expectations about speed limits that took precedence over recent experience in the simulator. Roads that historically had a 50 km/h speed limit but had been reduced to 40 km/h were still regarded as 50 km/h roads by the participants, underscoring the point that simply posting a sign with a lower speed limit is not enough to overcome drivers' expectations and habits associated with the visual appearance of a road. The findings provided insights into how drivers view and categorise roads, and identify specific areas that could be used to improve speed limit credibility.},

  issn = {00014575},
  abstract = {The potential for using road markings to indicate speed limits was investigated in a driving simulator over the course of two sessions. Two types of experimental road markings, an ``Attentional'' set designed to provide visually distinct cues to indicate speed limits of 60, 80 and 100 km/h, and a ``Perceptual'' set designed to also affect drivers' perception of speed, were compared to a standard undifferentiated set of markings. Participants (n = 20 per group) were assigned to one of four experimental groups (Attentional-Explicit, Attentional-Implicit, Perceptual-Explicit, Perceptual-Implicit) or a Control group (n = 22; standard road markings). The Explicit groups were instructed about the meaning of the road markings while those in the Implicit and Control groups did not receive any explanation. Participants drove five 10 km simulated roads containing three speed zones (60, 80 and 100 km/h) during the first session. The participants returned to the laboratory approximately 3 days later to drive five more trials including roads they had not seen before, a trial that included a secondary task, and a trial where speed signs were removed and only markings were present. The findings indicated that both types of road markings improved drivers' compliance with speed limits compared to the control group, but that explicit instruction as to the meaning of the markings was needed to realise their full benefit. Although previous research has indicated the benefit of road markings used as warnings to indicate speed reductions in advance of horizontal or vertical curves, the findings of the present experiment also suggest that systematically associating road markings with specific speed limits may be a useful way to improve speed limit compliance and increase speed homogeneity.},

The present study examined the relationship between drivers' perceptions of risk and the speeds they choose to drive. Participants drove high definition videos of familiar rural roads in a driving simulator and a smaller group of participants drove the same roads in a university fleet vehicle similar to the one used in the simulator. The results showed that double yellow and wide centreline markings were associated with lower speed choices and higher perceptions of risk, an effect magnified under high traffic conditions. Similarly, in both the simulator and on the roads, driving on narrow roads was associated with significantly lower speeds and increased risk ratings, while wider roads showed a small but significant increase in speeds as compared to standard width control roads. Finally, a range of other road and traffic conditions such as one-lane bridges, level crossings, police cars, and crash area warning signs were also found to be associated with lower speed choices and higher risk perceptions.},

Then, some misclassified pixels in the road class is removed using the road values in the normalized Digital Surface Model and Normalized Difference Distance features. In the postprocessing stage, a method based on Radon transform and Spline interpolation is employed to automatically locate and fill the gaps in the road network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm for gap filling works well on straight roads. The proposed road extraction algorithm is tested on three datasets. An accuracy assessment indicated 63.7 percent, 60.26 percent and 66.71 percent quality for three datasets. Finally, centerline of the detected roads is extracted using mathematical morphology.},

The LIDAR system not only generates the 3D points cloud with irregular spacing, but also detects the laser impulse reflection data. The algorithms used for the LIDAR data are mostly used to deal with the 3D points cloud, produce the digital terrain model (DTM) and detect the objects, such as buildings. Usually, these objects must be classified as part of the extraction. In order to classify, other information besides the height information of points cloud is required, such as laser intensity information. However, few classification algorithms using intensity data have been deeply investigated. The laser intensity is different from material to material. The intensity of reflection on the same material is similar, while pulsed on different material is differ. Based on this theory, this paper provides a classification algorithm of airborne laser scanning altimetry data combined with the intensity of laser in detail.},

  abstract = {We present a method for identifying drivable surfaces in difficult unpaved and offroad terrain conditions as encountered in the DARPA Grand Challenge robot race. Instead of relying on a static, pre-computed road appearance model, this method adjusts its model to changing environments. It achieves robustness by combining sensor information from a laser range finder, a pose estimation system and a color camera. Using the first two modalities, the system first identifies a nearby patch of drivable surface. Computer Vision then takes this patch and uses it to construct appearance models to find drivable surface outward into the far range. This information is put into a drivability map for the vehicle path planner. In addition to evaluating the method's performance using a scoring framework run on real-world data, the system was entered, and won, the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Post-race log-file analysis proved that without the Computer Vision algorithm, the vehicle would not have driven fast enough to win.},

Specifically, this paper introduces LADAR based terrain evaluation algorithms for an urban environments as well as off road. The terrain evaluation algorithm is very important for safe driving at high speed. On the real road, the driver is faced with numerous road conditions such as the smoothness of the road surface, curbs, or debris. For an unmanned vehicle to be successful, the algorithm has to decide whether the surface is traversable or non-traversable. For this reason, this paper focuses on the problem of extracting the ground terrain surface from 3-D point clouds obtained from LADAR sensors. The paper outlines the approach used by the University of Florida's Team Gator Nation to address the question of classifying traversable road conditions.},

These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classification and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We first discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied to high resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this definition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramifications of the different theoretical foundations between the `per-pixel paradigm' and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as defined by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm.},

While several feature selection methods have been used in conjunction with OBIA, a robust comparison of the utility and efficiency of approaches would facilitate broader and more effective implementation. In this study, we evaluated three feature selection methods, (1) Jeffreys\textendash{}Matusita distance (JM), (2) classification tree analysis (CTA), and (3) feature space optimization (FSO) for object-based vegetation classifications with sub-decimeter digital aerial imagery in arid rangelands of the southwestern U.S. We assessed strengths, weaknesses, and best uses for each method using the criteria of ease of use, ability to rank and/or reduce input features, and classification accuracies. For the five sites tested, JM resulted in the highest overall classification accuracies for three sites, while CTA yielded highest accuracies for two sites. FSO resulted in the lowest accuracies. CTA offered ease of use and ability to rank and reduce features, while JM had the advantage of assessing class separation distances. FSO allowed for determining features relatively quickly, because it operates within the OBIA software used in this analysis (eCognition). However, the feature ranking in FSO is not transparent and accuracies were relatively low. While all methods offered an objective approach for determining suitable features for classifications of sub-decimeter resolution aerial imagery, we concluded that CTA was best suited for this particular application. We explore the limitations, assumptions, and appropriate uses for this and other datasets.},

Hierarchical patch dynamics (HPD) is adopted as the theoretical framework to address issues of heterogeneity, scale, connectivity and quasi-equilibriums in landscapes. Remote sensing has emerged as the most useful data source for characterizing land use/land cover but a vast majority of applications rely on basic image processing concepts developed in the 1970s: one spatial scale, per-pixel classification of a multi-scale spectral feature space. We argue that this methodology does not make sufficient use of spatial concepts of neighbourhood, proximity or homogeneity. In contrast, the authors demonstrate in this article the utility of the HPD framework as a theoretical basis for landscape analysis in two different projects using alternative image processing methodologies, which try to overcome the `pixel-centred' view.},

In this article, the characteristics of laser scanning will be compared to photogrammetry with reference to a big pilot project. Laser scanning supplies data with a skew distribution of errors because a portion of the supplied points is not on the terrain but on the treetops. Thus, the usual interpolation and filtering has to be adapted to this new data type. We will report on the implementation of this new method. The results are in accordance with the expectations. The geomorphologic quality of the contours, computed from a terrain model derived from laser scanning, needs to be improved.

  volume = {214},
  issn = {0169555X},
  abstract = {Mapping or ``delimiting'' landforms is one of geomorphology's primary tools. Computer-based techniques such as land-surface segmentation allow the emulation of the process of manual landform delineation. Land-surface segmentation exhaustively subdivides a digital elevation model (DEM) into morphometrically-homogeneous irregularly-shaped regions, called terrain segments. Terrain segments can be created from various land-surface parameters (LSP) at multiple scales, and may therefore potentially correspond to the spatial extents of landforms such as drumlins. However, this depends on the segmentation algorithm, the parameterization, and the LSPs. In the present study we assess the widely used multiresolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm for its potential in providing terrain segments which delimit drumlins. Supervised testing was based on five 5-m DEMs that represented a set of 173 synthetic drumlins at random but representative positions in the same landscape. Five LSPs were tested, and four variants were computed for each LSP to assess the impact of median filtering of DEMs, and logarithmic transformation of LSPs. The testing scheme (1) employs MRS to partition each LSP exhaustively into 200 coarser scales of terrain segments by increasing the scale parameter (SP), (2) identifies the spatially best matching terrain segment for each reference drumlin, and (3) computes four segmentation accuracy metrics for quantifying the overall spatial match between drumlin segments and reference drumlins. Results of 100 tests showed that MRS tends to perform best on LSPs that are regionally derived from filtered DEMs, and then logtransformed. MRS delineated 97\% of the detected drumlins at SP values between 1 and 50. Drumlin delimitation rates with values up to 50\% are in line with the success of manual interpretations. Synthetic DEMs are well-suited for assessing landform quantification methods such as MRS, since subjectivity in the reference data is avoided which increases the reliability, validity and applicability of results.},

  volume = {65},
  issn = {09242716},
  abstract = {Remote sensing imagery needs to be converted into tangible information which can be utilised in conjunction with other data sets, often within widely used Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As long as pixel sizes remained typically coarser than, or at the best, similar in size to the objects of interest, emphasis was placed on per-pixel analysis, or even sub-pixel analysis for this conversion, but with increasing spatial resolutions alternative paths have been followed, aimed at deriving objects that are made up of several pixels. This paper gives an overview of the development of object based methods, which aim to delineate readily usable objects from imagery while at the same time combining image processing and GIS functionalities in order to utilize spectral and contextual information in an integrative way. The most common approach used for building objects is image segmentation, which dates back to the 1970s. Around the year 2000 GIS and image processing started to grow together rapidly through object based image analysis (OBIA - or GEOBIA for geospatial object based image analysis). In contrast to typical Landsat resolutions, high resolution images support several scales within their images. Through a comprehensive literature review several thousand abstracts have been screened, and more than 820 OBIA-related articles comprising 145 journal papers, 84 book chapters and nearly 600 conference papers, are analysed in detail. It becomes evident that the first years of the OBIA/GEOBIA developments were characterised by the dominance of `grey' literature, but that the number of peer-reviewed journal articles has increased sharply over the last four to five years. The pixel paradigm is beginning to show cracks and the OBIA methods are making considerable progress towards a spatially explicit information extraction workflow, such as is required for spatial planning as well as for many monitoring programmes.},

This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne LIDAR systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a DTM, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground LIDAR measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.},

There are also indications of such effects on first-birth rates, in the upper 20s and 30s. Whereas a high fertility among the better-educated perhaps could be explained by socioeconomic or ideational factors, it might just as well be a result of selection. When all three parity transitions are modelled jointly, with a common unobserved factor included, negative effects of educational level appear. On the whole, the effects are less clearly negative for women born in the 1950s than for those born in the 1940s or late 1930s. The cohorts from the 1950s show educational differentials in completed fertility that are quite small and to a large extent stem from a higher proportion of childlessness among the better-educated. Second-birth progression ratios are just as high for the college educated as for women with only compulsory education, and the third-birth progression ratios differ very little. This reflects weakly negative net effects of education after first birth and spill-over effects from the higher age at first birth, counterbalanced by differential selectivity of earlier parity transitions.},

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {Period fertility started to drop significantly below replacement in most Western European countries during the 1970s and 1980s, while most fertility surveys, value studies and opinion polls have found that the number of children considered ideal for society or for one's own family has remained above two children per woman. These surveys have led to the expectation that, sooner or later, period fertility would recover in Europe. The most recent data from the Eurobarometer 2001 survey, however, suggest that in the German-speaking parts of Europe the average ideal family sizes given by younger men and women have fallen as low as 1.7 children. This paper examines the consistency and the credibility of these new findings, which \textendash{} if they are indeed indications of a new trend \textendash{} may alter the current discussion about future fertility trends in Europe.},

  abstract = {There are trends towards centralising hospital care within the NHS, for many excellent reasons. Yet this has a disproportionate 
impact upon those patients who live at a distance from their hospital, and this impact has not been well reported or researched, but 
studies have demonstrated that the utilisation of services is inversely related to the distance of the patient from the hospital; so-called 
`distance decay'. This article examines the trend and describes the reasons for it, and the impact on those living in remote and rural 
communities. It argues that health service planning needs to be patient centred, and points out that, although providing services to 
rural communities is more expensive than that for urban populations, a balance needs to be struck between cost-effectiveness and 
the provision of accessible and equitable services for all of our patients. It argues for a debate to help define where that balance point 
should be, and makes certain recommendations. This debate is especially important, because the professions urgently need to decide},

  abstract = {Objectives: Reconfiguration of emergency services could lead to patients with life-threatening conditions travelling longer distances to hospital. Concerns have been raised that this could increase the risk of death. We aimed to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality in patients with lifethreatening emergencies.
Methods: We undertook an observational cohort study of 10 315 cases transported with a potentially lifethreatening condition (excluding cardiac arrests) by four English ambulance services to associated acute hospitals, to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality, after adjustment for age, sex, clinical category and illness severity.
Results: Straight-line ambulance journey distances ranged from 0 to 58 km with a median of 5 km, and 644 patients died (6.2\%). Increased distance was associated with increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.02 per kilometre; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p,0.001). This association was not changed by adjustment for confounding by age, sex, clinical category or illness severity. Patients with respiratory emergencies showed the greatest association between distance and mortality.
Conclusion: Increased journey distance to hospital appears to be associated with increased risk of mortality. Our data suggest that a 10-km increase in straight-line distance is associated with around a 1\% absolute increase in mortality.},

  abstract = {Past design consistency research has demonstrated the relationship between operating speeds and geometric design features on two-lane rural highways. However, little is known about the relationship between geometric design consistency and traffic safety. In this study, design consistency is referred to as the difference between operating speed and inferred design speed, and design consistency density is measured to account for the effect of elements upstream and downstream of the study element. To perform the design consistency\textendash{}safety evaluation in the present study, geometric design, roadway inventory, crash, and operating speed data were collected along two case-study highways in central Pennsylvania (U.S. 322 and PA 350). Several count regression model formulations were used to explore the statistical association between design consistency and total crash frequency. A statistically significant positive association between geometric design consistency and safety was found. Design consistency surrounding the study elements was also found to increase the expected crash frequency in the study element. The significant effects of design consistency and design consistency density measures on crash frequency for the two case-study sites indicate that there is value in further considering the relationship between design consistency and safety in future research, particularly in the context of the highway safety manual crash-prediction algorithm.

  issn = {0300-5771, 1464-3685},
  shorttitle = {Neighbourhood Food Environment and Area Deprivation},
  abstract = {Background The `deprivation amplification' hypothesis suggests that residents of deprived neighbourhoods have universally poorer access to highquality food environments, which in turn contributes to the development of spatial inequalities in diet and diet-related chronic disease. This paper presents results from a study that quantified access to grocery stores selling fresh fruit and vegetables in four environmental settings in Scotland, UK.
Methods Spatial accessibility, as measured by network travel times, to 457 grocery stores located in 205 neighbourhoods in four environmental settings (island, rural, small town and urban) in Scotland was calculated using Geographical Information Systems. The distribution of accessibility by neighbourhood deprivation in each of these four settings was investigated.
Results Overall, the most deprived neighbourhoods had the best access to grocery stores and grocery stores selling fresh produce. Stratified analysis by environmental setting suggests that the least deprived compared with the most deprived urban neighbourhoods have greater accessibility to grocery stores than their counterparts in island, rural and small town locations. Access to fresh produce is better in more deprived compared with less deprived urban and small town neighbourhoods, but poorest in the most affluent island communities with mixed results for rural settings.
Conclusions The results presented here suggest that the assumption of a universal `deprivation amplification' hypothesis in studies of the neighbourhood food environment may be misguided. Associations between neighbourhood deprivation and grocery store accessibility vary by environmental setting.

  volume = {53},
  issn = {13698478},
  abstract = {Globally, motor vehicle crashes account for over 1.2 million fatalities per year and are the leading cause of death for people aged 15\textendash{}29 years. The majority of road crashes are caused by human error, with risk heightened among young and novice drivers learning to negotiate the complexities of the road environment. Direct feedback has been shown to have a positive impact on driving behaviour. Methods that could detect behavioural changes and therefore, positively reinforce safer driving during the early stages of driver licensing could have considerable road safety benefit. A new methodology is presented combining in-vehicle telematics technology, providing measurements forming a personalised driver profile, with neural networks to identify changes in driving behaviour. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, individual drivers are identified based on their pattern of acceleration, deceleration and exceeding the speed limit. After model calibration, new, real-time data of the driver is supplied to the LSTM and, by monitoring prediction performance, one can assess whether a (positive or negative) change in driving behaviour is occurring over time. The paper highlights that the approach is robust to different neural network structures, data selections, calibration settings, and methodologies to select benchmarks for safe and unsafe driving. Presented case studies show additional model applications for investigating changes in driving behaviour among individuals following or during specific events (e.g., receipt of insurance renewal letters) and time periods (e.g., driving during holiday periods). The application of the presented methodology shows potential to form the basis of timely provision of direct feedback to drivers by telematics-based insurers. Such feedback may prevent internalisation of new, risky driving habits contributing to crash risk, potentially reducing deaths and injuries among young drivers as a result.},

  abstract = {In this paper an efficient method for automatic road extraction in rural and semi-urban areas is presented. This work seeks the GIS update starting from color images and using preexisting vectorial information. As input data only the RGB bands of a satellite or aerial color image of high resolution is required. The system includes four different modules: data preprocessing; binary segmentation based on three levels of texture statistical evaluation; automatic vectorization by means of skeletal extraction; and finally a module for system evaluation. In the first module the color image is rectified and geo-referenced. The second module uses a new technique, named Texture Progressive Analysis (TPA), in order to obtain the segmented binary image. The TPA technique is developed in the evidence theory framework, and it consists in fusing information streaming from three different sources for the image. In the third module the obtained binary image is vectorized using an algorithm based on skeleton extraction techniques and morphological methods. The result is an extracted road network which is defined as a structural set of elements geometrically and topologically corrects. The fourth module is an evaluation of the procedure using a popular method. Experimental results show that this method is efficient in extracting and defining road networks from high resolution satellite and aerial imagery.},

Road marking is a signalization present on road surfaces and commonly used to inform the correct lane cars must keep. Cameras have been widely used for road marking detection, however they are sensible to environment illumination. Some LIDAR sensors return infrared reflective intensity information which is insensible to illumination condition. Existing road marking detectors that analyzes reflective intensity data focus only on lane markings and ignores other types of signalization. We propose a road marking detector based on Otsu thresholding method that make possible segment LIDAR point clouds into asphalt and road marking. The results show the possibility of detecting any road marking (crosswalks, continuous lines, dashed lines). The road marking detector has also been integrated with Monte Carlo localization method so that its performance could be validated. According to the results, adding road markings onto curb maps lead to a lateral localization error of 0.3119 m.},

  abstract = {In the context of spatial analysis, spatial disaggregation or spatial downscaling are processes by which information at a coarse spatial scale is translated to finer scales, while maintaining consistency with the original dataset. Fine-grained descriptions of geographical information is a key resource in fields such as social-economic studies, urban and regional planning, transport planning, or environmental impact analysis. One such method for spacial disaggregation is the dissever algorithm, a hybrid approach that combines pycnophylactic interpolation and regression-based dasymetric mapping, leveraging auxiliary data to increase desegregation precision. Implemented in R, the current dissever version assumes a sequential execution model and the usage of smaller-than-ram computational sequences, limiting the resolution and scale of usable datasets. This paper presents a variant of the dissever algorithm, called S-Dissever (Scalable Dissever) suitable for efficiently executing in parallel environments, taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures, while using secondary memory to scale out computations that exceed RAM capacity. Experimental evaluations on the S-Dissever demonstrate the feasibility of the desegregation procedure while using high-resolution auxiliary data at significant geographical extents, as well as notable speedups obtained by the utilization of multi-core environments.},

It is basic information for further analysis in several applications including road surface settlement, pavement condition assessment and slope collapse. Mobile LiDAR system (MLS) is frequently used now a days to collect detail road surface and its surrounding information in terms three-dimensional (3D) point cloud. Extraction of road surface from volumetric point cloud data is still in infancy stage because of heavy data processing requirement and the complexity in the road environment. The extraction of roads especially rural road, where road-curb is not present is very tedious job especially in Indian roadway settings. Only a few studies are available, and none for Indian roads, in the literature for rural road detection. The limitations of existing studies are in terms of their lower accuracy, very slow speed of data processing and detection of other objects having similar characteristics as the road surface. A fast and accurate method is proposed for LiDAR data points of road surface detection, keeping in mind the essence of road surface extraction especially for Indian rural roads. The Mobile LiDAR data in XYZI format is used as input in the proposed method. First square gridding is performed and ground points are roughly extracted. Then planar surface detection using mathematical framework of principal component analysis (PCA) is performed and further road surface points are detected using similarity in intensity and height difference of road surface pointe in their neighbourhood.},

  abstract = {The road network plays an important role in the modern traffic system; as development occurs, the road structure changes frequently. Owing to the advancements in the field of high-resolution remote sensing, and the success of semantic segmentation success using deep learning in computer version, extracting the road network from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly popular, and has become a new tool to update the geospatial database. Considering that the training dataset of the deep convolutional neural network will be clipped to a fixed size, which lead to the roads run through each sample, and that different kinds of road types have different widths, this work provides a segmentation model that was designed based on densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) and introduces the local and global attention units. The aim of this work is to propose a novel road extraction method that can efficiently extract the road network from remote sensing imagery with local and global information. A dataset from Google Earth was used to validate the method, and experiments showed that the proposed deep convolutional neural network can extract the road network accurately and effectively. This method also achieves a harmonic mean of precision and recall higher than other machine learning and deep learning methods.},

  abstract = {Clothing is a fundamental part of a character's persona, a key storytelling tool used to convey an intended impression to the audience. Draping, folding, wrinkling, stretching, etc. all convey meaning, and thus each is carefully controlled when filming live actors. When making films with computer simulated cloth, these subtle but important elements must be captured. In this paper we present several methods essential to matching the behavior and look of clothing worn by digital stand-ins to their real world counterparts. Novel contributions include a mixed explicit/implicit time integration scheme, a physically correct bending model with (potentially) nonzero rest angles for pre-shaping wrinkles, an interface forecasting technique that promotes the development of detail in contact regions, a post-processing method for treating cloth-character collisions that preserves folds and wrinkles, and a dynamic constraint mechanism that helps to control large scale folding. The common goal of all these techniques is to produce a cloth simulation with many folds and wrinkles improving the realism.},

Then, buildings and trees were distinguished in an energy minimization framework after incorporation of two new features. The separation provided supportive information for later road extractions. After that, we designed structure templates to search for roads on ground intensity images, and road widths and orientations were determined by a subsequent voting scheme. This local searching process produced road candidates only, in order to prune false positives and infer undetected roads, a scene-dependent Markov network was constructed to help infer a global road network. Combination of local template fitting and global MRF inference made extracted ground roads more accurate and complete. Finally, we extended developed methods to elevated roads extraction from non-ground points and combined them with the ground road network to formulate a whole network.},

One specific case of this problem is the task of automatically detecting roads. This task is a difficult vision problem because of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of non-road objects. Despite 30 years of work on automatic road detection, no automatic or semi-automatic road detection system is currently on the market and no published method has been shown to work reliably on large datasets of urban imagery. We propose detecting roads using a neural network with millions of trainable weights which looks at a much larger context than was used in previous attempts at learning the task. The network is trained on massive amounts of data using a consumer GPU. We demonstrate that predictive performance can be substantially improved by initializing the feature detectors using recently developed unsupervised learning methods as well as by taking advantage of the local spatial coherence of the output labels. We show that our method works reliably on two challenging urban datasets that are an order of magnitude larger than what was used to evaluate previous approaches.},

  issn = {2072-4292},
  abstract = {The road networks provide key information for a broad range of applications such as urban planning, urban management, and navigation. The fast-developing technology of remote sensing that acquires high-resolution observational data of the land surface offers opportunities for automatic extraction of road networks. However, the road networks extracted from remote sensing images are likely affected by shadows and trees, making the road map irregular and inaccurate. This research aims to improve the extraction of road centerlines using both very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by accounting for road connectivity. The proposed method first applies the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to segment remote sensing images into image objects and then classifies image objects using the machine learning classifier, random forest. A post-processing approach based on the minimum area bounding rectangle (MABR) is proposed and a structure feature index is adopted to obtain the complete road networks. Finally, a multistep approach, that is, morphology thinning, Harris corner detection, and least square fitting (MHL) approach, is designed to accurately extract the road centerlines from the complex road networks. The proposed method is applied to three datasets, including the New York dataset obtained from the object identification dataset, the Vaihingen dataset obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2D semantic labelling benchmark and Guangzhou dataset. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can obtain the highest completeness, correctness, and quality for the three datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is an efficient solution for extracting road centerlines in complex scenes from VHR aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data.},

Then, for all the training image pixels which have corresponding Lidar points, we extract their features from color image and Lidar point clouds, respectively, and use these features together with the location features to train an Adaboost classifier. After that, all the testing pixels are classified into road or non-road under a conditional random field framework. In this conditional random field framework, we use the scores computed from the Adaboost classifier as the unary potential and take the height value of each pixel and its color information into consideration together for the pairwise potential. Finally, experimental tests have been carried out on the KITTI Road data set, and the results show that our method performs well on this data set.},

  abstract = {The extraction of road network is an emerging area in information extraction from high-resolution satellite images (HRSI). It is also an interesting field that incorporates various tactics to achieve road network. The process of road detection from remote sensing images is quite complex, due to the presence of various noises. These noises could be the vehicles, crossing lines and toll bridges. Few small and large false road segments interrupt the extraction of road segments that happens due to the similar spectral behavior in heterogeneous objects. To achieve a better level of accuracy, numerous factors play their important role, such as spectral data of satellite sensor and the information related to land surface area. Therefore the interpretation varies on processing of images with different heuristic parameters. These parameters have tuned according to the road characteristics of the terrain in satellite images. There are several approaches proposed and implemented to extract the roads from HRSI comprising a single or hybrid method. This kind of hybrid approach has also improved the accuracy of road extraction in comparison to a single approach. Some characteristics related to impervious and non-impervious surfaces are used as salient features that help to improve the extraction of road area only in the correct manner. These characteristics also used to utilize the spatial, spectral and texture features to increase the accuracy of classified results. Therefore, aforesaid characteristics have been utilized in combination of road spectral properties to extract road network only with improved accuracy. This evaluated road network is quite accurate with the help of these defined methodologies.},

In this paper, we present a practical real-time working prototype for road lane detection using LiDAR data, which can be further extended to automatic lane-level map generation. Conventional lane detection methods are limited to simple road conditions and are not suitable for complex urban roads with various road signs on the ground. Given a 3D point cloud scanned by a 3D LiDAR sensor, we categorized the points of the drivable region and distinguished the points of the road signs on the ground. Then, we developed an expectation-maximization method to detect parallel lines and update the 3D line parameters in real time, as the probe vehicle equipped with the LiDAR sensor moved forward. The detected and recorded line parameters were integrated to build a lane-level digital map with the help of a GPS/INS sensor. The proposed system was tested to generate accurate lane-level maps of two complex urban routes. The experimental results showed that the proposed system was fast and practical in terms of effectively detecting road lines and generating lane-level maps.},

  abstract = {Crashes on rural roads are a major road safety problem, accounting for up to twothirds of deaths and serious injuries worldwide. Rural intersections, in particular, are dangerous locations, accounting for over 30 percent of these rural crashes. Most collisions at intersections occur in high-speed settings, at intersections that are uncontrolled or controlled by stop or give-way signs, and often on low-volume, single-carriageway roads. This paper provides an overview of a systematic review of international literature, identifies `best-practice' measures to reduce crash and injury risk at rural intersections and describes cutting-edge strategies and evaluation of infrastructure measures for managing safety at rural intersections. Cost-effective measures include: measures to reduce speed and speeding and the injury consequences, speed perception measures, roundabouts, traffic signals, gradeseparation, channelisation, signing to clarify priority, removal of sight distance obstructions, provision of medians, skid-resistant pavements and limited access from side roads and driveways. The paper highlights the need to address key crash problems at rural intersections by developing and implementing a system-wide and comprehensive approach that fundamentally improves the operation and design of these locations.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial optical images as well as coregistered LiDAR data opens great opportunities for improving objectlevel dense semantic labeling of airborne remote sensing imagery. As a result, efficient and effective multisensor fusion techniques are needed to fully exploit these complementary data modalities. Recent researches demonstrated how to process remote sensing images using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion approach using a probabilistic graphical model for the task of dense semantic labeling. Our proposed method first obtains two initial probabilistic labeling predictions from a fully-convolutional neural network and a linear classifier, e.g. logistic regression, respectively. These two predictions are then combined within a higher-order conditional random field (CRF). We utilize graph cut inference to estimate the final dense semantic labeling results. Higher-order CRF modeling helps to resolve fusion ambiguities by explicitly using the spatial contextual information, which can be learned from the training data. Experiments on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling Potsdam dataset show that our proposed approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

This information can assist road authorities in carrying out safety risk assessment studies along road networks. The knowledge of the road edge is also a prerequisite for the automatic estimation of most other road features. In this paper, we present an algorithm which has been developed for extracting left and right road edges from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data. The algorithm is based on a novel combination of two modified versions of the parametric active contour or snake model. The parameters involved in the algorithm are selected empirically and are fixed for all the road sections. We have developed a novel way of initialising the snake model based on the navigation information obtained from the mobile mapping vehicle. We tested our algorithm on different types of road sections representing rural, urban and national primary road sections. The successful extraction of road edges from these multiple road section environments validates our algorithm. These findings and knowledge provide valuable insights as well as a prototype road edge extraction toolset, for both national road authorities and survey companies.},

  abstract = {Spatially disaggregate ward level data for England is used in an analysis of various area-wide factors on road casualties. Data on 8414 wards was input into a geographic information system that contained data on land use types, road characteristics and road casualties. Demographic data on area-wide deprivation (the index of multiple deprivation) for each ward was also included. Negative binomial count data models were used to analyze the associations between these factors with traffic fatalities, serious injuries and slight injuries. Results suggest that urbanized areas are associated with fewer casualties (especially fatalities) while areas of higher employment density are associated with more casualties. More deprived areas tend to have higher levels of casualties, though not of motorized casualties (except slight injuries). The effect of road characteristics are less significant but there are some positive associations with the density of ``A'' and ``B'' level roads.},

For the (semi-)automated extraction of geo-information from point clouds these high point densities are very beneficial. The large number of points on the surfaces of objects to be extracted describe the surface geometry with a high redundancy. This allows the reliable detection of such surfaces in a point cloud. In this paper various examples are presented on how point cloud segmentations can be used to automatically extract geo-information. The paper focusses on the extraction of man-made objects in the urban environment. The examples include the processing of point clouds acquired by airborne, mobile as well as terrestrial laser scanners. The usage of generic knowledge on the objects to be mapped is shown to play a key role in the automation of the point cloud interpretation.},

  title = {An {{Easy}}-to-{{Use Airborne LiDAR Data Filtering Method Based}} on {{Cloth Simulation}}},
  volume = {8},
  issn = {2072-4292},
  abstract = {Separating point clouds into ground and non-ground measurements is an essential step to generate digital terrain models (DTMs) from airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data. However, most filtering algorithms need to carefully set up a number of complicated parameters to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, we present a new filtering method which only needs a few easy-to-set integer and Boolean parameters. Within the proposed approach, a LiDAR point cloud is inverted, and then a rigid cloth is used to cover the inverted surface. By analyzing the interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface. Finally, the ground points can be extracted from the LiDAR point cloud by comparing the original LiDAR points and the generated surface. Benchmark datasets provided by ISPRS (International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) working Group III/3 are used to validate the proposed filtering method, and the experimental results yield an average total error of 4.58\%, which is comparable with most of the state-of-the-art filtering algorithms. The proposed easy-to-use filtering method may help the users without much experience to use LiDAR data and related technology in their own applications more easily.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to detect and construct a 3D geometric model of an urban area with complex buildings using aerial LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. The LIDAR data collected from a nadir direction is a point cloud containing surface samples of not only the building roofs and terrain but also undesirable clutter from trees, cars, etc. The main contribution of this work is the automatic recognition and estimation of simple parametric shapes that can be combined to model very complex buildings from aerial LIDAR data. The main components of the detection and modeling algorithms are (i) Segmentation of roof and terrain points. (ii) Roof topology Inference. We introduce the concept of a roof-topology graph to represent the relationships between the various planar patches of a complex roof structure. (iii) Parametric roof composition. Simple parametric roof shapes that can be combined to create a complex roof structure of a building are recognized by searching for sub-graphs in its roof-topology graph. (iv) Terrain Modeling. The terrain is identified and modeled as a triangulated mesh. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the validity of our approach for rapid and automatic building detection and geometric modeling with real LIDAR data. We are able to model cities and other urban areas at the rate of about 10 minutes per sq. mile on a low-end PC.},

  title = {Aerial Image Geolocalization from Recognition and Matching of Roads and Intersections},
  abstract = {Aerial image analysis at a semantic level is important in many applications with strong potential impact in industry and consumer use, such as automated mapping, urban planning, real estate and environment monitoring, or disaster relief. The problem is enjoying a great interest in computer vision and remote sensing, due to increased computer power and improvement in automated image understanding algorithms. In this paper we address the task of automatic geolocalization of aerial images from recognition and matching of roads and intersections. Our proposed method is a novel contribution in the literature that could enable many applications of aerial image analysis when GPS data is not available. We offer a complete pipeline for geolocalization, from the detection of roads and intersections, to the identification of the enclosing geographic region by matching detected intersections to previously learned manually labeled ones, followed by accurate geometric alignment between the detected roads and the manually labeled maps. We test on a novel dataset with aerial images of two European cities and use the publicly available OpenStreetMap project for collecting ground truth roads annotations. We show in extensive experiments that our approach produces highly accurate localizations in the challenging case when we train on images from one city and test on the other and the quality of the aerial images is relatively poor. We also show that the the alignment between detected roads and pre-stored manual annotations can be effectively used for improving the quality of the road detection results.},

It lacks differentiation between points measured on the terrain itself and points measured on man-made or natural objects (buildings, roads, trees etc.). In this paper, an automatic method for DTM extraction in urban areas is presented. The method is based on an initial approximation of the DTM determined by using the road network, followed by an iterative processing technique that enables computing the final (``true'') DTM. For detection of roads, segmentations based on normal direction, edge detection and height difference are used. Based on our preliminary tests, some of which are presented in this paper, the results point to a promising solution.},

The Atlanta Beltline will ultimately connect 45 Atlanta neighborhoods via a 22-mile loop of trails, parks, and eventually a streetcar, all of which follow abandoned railroad tracks. This paper examines the effect of the Beltline on housing values within one half mile. From 2011 to 2015, depending on the segment of the Beltline, values rose between 17.9 percent and 26.6 percent more for homes within a half-mile of the Beltline than elsewhere. The implications for housing affordability and neighborhood change of projects like the Beltline, and associated policy questions, are addressed.},

As previous advocates of a scalar turn, we now question the privileging, in any form, of a single dimension of sociospatial processes, scalar or otherwise. We consider several recent sophisticated `turns' within critical social science; explore their methodological limitations; and highlight several important strands of sociospatial theory that seek to transcend the latter. On this basis, we argue for a more systematic recognition of polymorphy{\"o}the organization of sociospatial relations in multiple forms{\"o}within sociospatial theory. Specifically, we suggest that territories (T), places (P), scales (S), and networks (N) must be viewed as mutually constitutive and relationally intertwined dimensions of sociospatial relations. We present this proposition as an extension of recent contributions to the spatialization of the strategic-relational approach (SRA), and we explore some of its methodological implications. We conclude by briefly illustrating the applicability of the `TPSN framework' to several realms of inquiry into sociospatial processes under contemporary capitalism.},

The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units.

  volume = {40},
  issn = {0042-0980, 1360-063X},
  abstract = {This paper looks at demand issues in gentrification. It takes as its basic proposition that everyone involved in the demand side belongs to the same economic class and therefore possesses the same set of motivations; that `otherness' in gentrification is something that needs to be problematised rather than assumed. It argues that the presumption of otherness arises because accounts of demand for gentrification begin at the end, from achieved housing situation, and argue back, rather than at the beginning, with means. The motivations of gentrifiers, suburbanites and displacees are the same, a concern for defining and preserving identity in the modern world: what differ between them are the means at the disposal of each group. Concern with identity means taking seriously the importance of fashion in gentrification: gentrifiers and suburbanites are members of different status groups, using housing as status symbols to define and claim membership of those groups. Displacees are just as concerned with the maintenance of their identity, but do not have access to the same amount of resources as gentrifiers. Because the solution to the gentrifiers' identity crisis takes place at the expense of the displacee, gentrification takes on a synecdochal quality: the concerns expressed in struggles over gentrification exemplify the general concern with identity in conditions of modernity, which should be understood as the subjective experience of everyday life within a capitalist mode of production. The context within which these struggles over status take place is nonetheless class-constituted and class-laden. Gentrification and the struggles it engenders should be interpreted as a form of hegemonic practice. Ultimately, it is this that makes gentrification `gentrification'.},

The author examines the geographical concentration of deprivation, the extent, and whether there is a polarisation between areas. The evidence confirms that there is a clear rationale for area-based approaches, although it should not be assumed that they will be the most effective means to improve conditions in all cases. The evidence suggests that there should be a closer link between area-based approaches and national level main programmes, given the time limited nature of the former and the fact that they only reach a minority of all deprived people. The issues involved in identifying target areas are also reviewed including the question of who decides and on what basis. It is concluded that understanding the spatial distribution of deprivation is crucial and that there is an urgent need for better, more up to date statistical and other data relating to small geographical areas.},

In the experiments, four LIDAR images with different numbers of areas (sea, forest, desert, and urban) were used for examining the algorithm. The efficiency of image segmentation was generally evaluated visually because the segments of the main image typically lack certain, fixed features and depend on the criterion used for pattern distance/similarity as well as the threshold for cluster separation. For each experiment, hierarchical clustering method was employed by creating the clustering hierarchy tree and specifying the optimal number of clusters on the basis of tree data. Once the optimal number of clusters was determined, the similarity matrix of data image patterns was separated according to Euclidean distance algorithm in terms of greatest similarity among the patterns to the number of clusters. Clustering was then performed. The program output comprised labeled images for samples specifying which pattern pertains to which cluster. The images associated with each cluster are displayed separated from other clusters with other areas eliminated. The results indicated that for LIDAR images that lack a certain, fixed feature, the hierarchical clustering method for segmentation can perform separation and labeling.},

  abstract = {Road data in 3-dimensional forms is required for a variety of geospatial applications e.g. road maintenance, transport planning and location-based services. Although airborne lidar can produce dense point clouds from which 3-dimensional road information can be retrieved in detail, lidar data is often incomplete due to the line-of-sight requirement, and therefore a better result of information extraction from lidar data can be achieved if supplement data is used. This paper presents a novel algorithm for road extraction from lidar point clouds and associative vector data. A moving window-based classification technique using various cues determined from the lidar data is applied in a hierarchical way to separate road from other objects. In order to fill the gaps caused by the line-of-sight problem e.g. shadows of trees and buildings, the vector data is used in the refinement process to improve the results by including a buffer, deleting false positives, interpolating and fitting the road-representing points into polylines. To validate the proposed algorithm, four samples of lidar data sets are tested. The test result shows that it is a practical method for road extraction from airborne lidar data for both structured and unstructured lanes.},

Appropriate property development can have positive economic effects but it has to be part of a more holistic approach that embodies concerns for people living in deprived areas and for the underlying condition of the local economy. Unrestrained market-led development may have detrimental consequences for the economic fabric of cities and for the quality of life of their residents.},

Further contextual effects were shown by significant random variability in the slopes of the relation between mental health and economic inactivity at the electoral division level. Our results suggest that the places in which people live affect their mental health, supporting NHS policy that multi-agency planning to reduce inequalities in mental health status should address the wider determinants of health, as well as services for individual patients.},

Evidence gleaned from the national evaluation of 2002/03 helps illuminate trends and tensions within three themes which have proved central to the wider urban debate: community engagement, partnership working, and the complexity of ABIs. On the broad canvas, evidence from the evaluation suggests that institutional factors continue to impinge strongly on the programme, that the original assumption that partnerships should be given a strong degree of local flexibility and freedoms has been steadily eroded, and that the initiative as a whole sits within that raft of essentially reformist policy interventions effected by the Labour government since 1997.},

Income inequality and relative poverty rates appear to be of greater importance for the variation in infant mortality rates than the level of economic development between rich countries. Levels of unemployment and of social security benefits seems to affect the infant mortality rate; the combination of high unemployment and low unemployment benefits seems to be associated with particularly high mortality rates. A high level of family benefits is also associated with low infant mortality rates.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that contact with the natural environment and green space promotes good health. It is also well known that participation in regular physical activity generates physical and psychological health benefits. The authors have hypothesised that `green exercise' will improve health and psychological well-being, yet few studies have quantified these effects. This study measured the effects of 10 green exercise case studies (including walking, cycling, horse-riding, fishing, canal-boating and conservation activities) in four regions of the UK on 263 participants. Even though these participants were generally an active and healthy group, it was found that green exercise led to a significant improvement in self-esteem and total mood disturbance (with anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection and tension-anxiety all improving post-activity). Self-esteem and mood were found not to be affected by the type, intensity or duration of the green exercise, as the results were similar for all 10 case studies. Thus all these activities generated mental health benefits, indicating the potential for a wider health and well-being dividend from green exercise. Green exercise thus has important implications for public and environmental health, and for a wide range of policy sectors.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the debates over the explanation of gentrification and argues that gentrification is best explained as the social and spatial manifestation of the transition from an industrial to a post-industrial economy based on financial, business and creative services, with associated changes in the nature and location of work, in the occupational class structure, earnings and incomes and the structure of the housing market. The paper sets out the links between these changes in the London context. It also examines the evidence for gentrification-induced displacement in London, arguing that it may be more appropriate to view the process partly as one of replacement.},

Methods: Cox proportional hazards models.
Results: There were large differences in the risk of limiting illness according to occupational social class, with men and women in the least favourable employment conditions nearly four times more likely to become ill than those in the most favourable. Unemployment and economic inactivity also had a powerful effect on illness incidence. Limiting illness was not a permanent state for most participants in the study. Employment status was also related to recovery.
Conclusions: Having secure employment in favourable working conditions greatly reduces the risk of healthy people developing limiting illness. Secure employment increases the likelihood of recovery. These findings have considerable implications for both health inequality and economic policies.},

  title = {Gendering {{Fertility}}},
  volume = {22},
  issn = {01675923},
  abstract = {With the growing prevalence of the dual-earner family model in industrialized countries the gendered nature of the relationship between employment and parenting has become a key issue for childbearing decisions and behavior. In such a context taking into account the societal gender structure (public policies, family-level gender relations) explicitly can enhance our understanding of contemporary fertility trends. In this paper we study the second birth, given its increasing importance in the developed world as large proportions of women remain childless or bear only one child. We focus on Sweden where gender equality is pronounced at both the societal and the family level and on Hungary where the dual-earner model has been accompanied by traditional gender relations in the home sphere. Our analysis is based on data extracted from the Swedish and Hungarian Fertility and Family Surveys of 1992/93. We use the method of hazard regression. The results suggest that the secondbirth intensity increases as the combination of parenthood and labor-force attachment of either parent is facilitated. We see this in the effect of family policies in Sweden and in the higher second-birth intensity of couples who share family responsibilities as compared to those with traditional gender-role behavior in both countries. Also, the lack of any visible impact of men's educational attainment in both Sweden and Hungary is probably linked to public policies as state support for families with children has reduced the importance of income for second childbearing. A positive educational gradient for Swedish women and an essentially zero gradient in Hungary reflects the success of policy measures in reducing fertility cost for more educated women in both countries.},

  shorttitle = {Fear of Crime and Health in Residential Tower Blocks},
  abstract = {Background: Though it is often assumed that fear of crime erodes mental health, research evidence is limited. Our study seeks to assess the relationship between these attributes in residents of the city of Liverpool. Method: Evidence is drawn from a sample survey of 407 adults living in 21 tower blocks. A number of social and psychosocial attributes linked with feelings of safety are compared with self-reported health status using logistic and multiple regression techniques. Possible reciprocal relationships were investigated using two-stage least squares. Results: Fear of crime in this sample is generally much lower in the home than in Britain as a whole and much higher out on the neighbouring streets at night, but there are sub-group variations. We find significant associations between fear of crime and health status. Feelings of safety when out alone after dark is the most consistent predictor of health status. Those feeling safe score significantly higher on all five dimensions of the SF-36 measure which cover mental and social well-being. Mental health is the strongest correlate and is probably a consequence rather than cause of feelings of safety. Conclusion: The evidence suggests elderly residents believe tower blocks provide safe accommodation. However, feelings of safety in these `fortresses' do not generally extend to walking in neighbouring streets. Fear of crime erodes quality of life and is associated with poorer health.},

  abstract = {In many countries census data are only reported for areal units and not at the individual level. This custom raises the spectre of ecological fallacy problems. In this paper, a 10\% sample census (from the United Kingdom) and individual census data (from Italy) are used to provide an empirical demonstration of the nature and magnitude of these problems. It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques. Finally, a suggestion is made concerning how the potentially serious practical consequences can be reduced.},

  shorttitle = {Do Urban Regeneration Programmes Improve Public Health and Reduce Health Inequalities?},
  abstract = {Objectives: To synthesise data on the impact on health and key socioeconomic determinants of health and health inequalities reported in evaluations of national UK regeneration programmes. Data Sources: Eight electronic databases were searched from 1980 to 2004 (IBSS, COPAC, HMIC, IDOX, INSIDE, Medline, Urbadisc/Accompline, Web of Knowledge). Bibliographies of located documents and relevant web sites were searched. Experts and government departmental libraries were also contacted. Review methods: Evaluations that reported achievements drawing on data from at least two target areas of a national urban regeneration programme in the UK were included. Process evaluations and evaluations reporting only business outcomes were excluded. All methods of evaluation were included. Impact data on direct health outcomes and direct measures of socioeconomic determinants of health were narratively synthesised.
Results: 19 evaluations reported impacts on health or socioeconomic determinants of health; data from 10 evaluations were synthesised. Three evaluations reported health impacts; in one evaluation three of four measures of self reported health deteriorated, typically by around 4\%. Two other evaluations reported overall reductions in mortality rates. Most socioeconomic outcomes assessed showed an overall improvement after regeneration investment; however, the effect size was often similar to national trends. In addition, some evaluations reported adverse impacts.
Conclusion: There is little evidence of the impact of national urban regeneration investment on socioeconomic or health outcomes. Where impacts have been assessed, these are often small and positive but adverse impacts have also occurred. Impact data from future evaluations are required to inform healthy public policy; in the meantime work to exploit and synthesise ``best available'' data is required.},
